4. Balls numbered $1,2,3, \ldots$ are deposited in 5 bins, labeled $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}$, and E , using the following procedure. Ball 1 is deposited in bin $A$, and balls 2 and 3 are deposited in bin $B$. The next 3 balls are deposited in bin C, the next 4 in bin D, and so on, cycling back to bin A after balls are deposited in bin E.

16. Jerry likes to play with numbers. One day, he wrote all the integers from 1 to 2024 on the whiteboard. Then he repeatedly chose four numbers on the whiteboard, erased them, and replaced them by either their sum or their product. (For example, Jerry's first step might have been to erase 1, 2, 3, and 5, and then write either 11, their sum, or 30, their product, on the whiteboard.) After repeatedly performing this operation, Jerry noticed that all the remaining numbers on the whiteboard were odd. What is the maximum possible number of integers on the whiteboard at that time?

(B) 1011
(C) 1012
(D) 1013
(E) 1014

Each of 27 bricks (right rectangular prisms) has dimensions $a \times b \times c$, where $a, b$, and $c$ are pairwise relatively prime positive integers. These bricks are arranged to form a $3 \times 3 \times 3$ block, as shown on the left below. A 28th brick with the same dimensions is introduced, and these bricks are reconfigured into a $2 \times 2 \times 7$ block, shown on the right. The new block is 1 unit taller, 1 unit wider, and 1 unit deeper than the old one. What is $a+b+c$ ?
(A) 88
(B) 89
(C) 90
(D) 91
(E) 92
