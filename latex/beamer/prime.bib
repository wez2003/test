  abstract  = {It is proved that $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }inf(p_{n+1}-p_n)\textless 7\times 10^7$, where pn is the n-th prime. Our method is a refinement of the recent work of Goldston, Pintz and Yildirim on the small gaps between consecutive primes. A major ingredient of the proof is a stronger version of the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem that is applicable when the moduli are free from large prime divisors only, but it is adequate for our purpose.},
